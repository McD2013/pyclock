the python file in this repo is a digital clock using the tkniter module. Here is an explanation of the code: 
tkinter as tk: Imports the Tkinter library, which is used for creating the GUI. The library is aliased as tk for convenience.
time: Imports the time library, which provides time-related functions. Then class DigitalClock: Defines a class named DigitalClock to encapsulate the functionality of the digital clock.
def __init__(self, root): The constructor method initializes the clock.
self.root = root: Sets the root window for the clock.
self.root.title("Digital Clock"): Sets the title of the window to "Digital Clock".
self.root.geometry("400x200"): Sets the size of the window to 400x200 pixels.
self.root.configure(bg='black'): Sets the background color of the window to black.
self.time_label and self.date_label: Create label widgets for displaying the time and date, respectively.
font=("Helvetica", 48): Sets the font to Helvetica with a size of 48 for the time label.
bg="black": Sets the background color of the labels to black.
fg="cyan" and fg="lightgreen": Sets the text color of the time label to cyan and the date label to light green.
self.time_label.pack(pady=20): Packs the time label into the window with a padding of 20 pixels on the y-axis.
self.date_label.pack(): Packs the date label into the window.
self.update_clock(): Calls the update_clock method to start updating the time and date.
def update_clock(self): Defines the method to update the time and date labels.
current_time = time.strftime("%H:%M:%S"): Gets the current time formatted as hours, minutes, and seconds.
current_date = time.strftime("%A, %d %B %Y"): Gets the current date formatted as day of the week, day, month, and year.
self.time_label.config(text=current_time): Updates the text of the time label with the current time.
self.date_label.config(text=current_date): Updates the text of the date label with the current date.
self.root.after(1000, self.update_clock): Schedules the update_clock method to be called again after 1000 milliseconds (1 second), creating a continuous update loop.if __name__ == "__main__":: Ensures the following code runs only if the script is executed directly, not if it is imported as a module.
root = tk.Tk(): Creates the main Tkinter window.
clock = DigitalClock(root): Creates an instance of the DigitalClock class, passing the main window as the root.
root.mainloop(): Starts the Tkinter event loop, which waits for user interactions and updates the GUI as needed.
